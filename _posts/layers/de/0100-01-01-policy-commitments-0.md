Marine plastic pollution has reached crisis levels. It is estimated that eleven million tonnes of plastic enter the world’s oceans every year, threatening marine life, coastal livelihoods, and potentially even human health. It is a global problem that urgently requires a global response: it is time to begin negotiations on a new legally binding global agreement.

The existing legal framework covering marine plastic pollution is fragmented and ineffective and does not provide the necessary tools for an effective global response to the problem. This issue cannot be solved on a national or regional level or through non-binding, voluntary measures alone. It requires coordinated international action, shared responsibility, and a common approach.

The Global Plastic Navigator had tracked the level of support of UN Member States for the start of negotiation on a new global treaty, up until March 2022, when the United Nations Environment Assembly, through [Resolution 5/14 (pdf)](https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/39812/OEWG_PP_1_INF_1_UNEA%20resolution.pdf), decided to start the negotiation of **an international legally binding instrument to end plastic pollution**, with the aim of concluding the negotiation by end of 2024.

WWF calls on states to maximise the potential of developing a new international legally binding agreement, by negotiating a treaty with specific, binding global rules to address the global problem of plastic pollution. WWF’s [submission (pdf)]( https://apps1.unep.org/resolutions/uploads/230106_wwfs_submission_on_potential_options_for_elements_towards_an_international_legally_binding_instrument_0.pdf) to the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee, provides further information on WWF’s key recommendations on the potential options for elements towards an international legally binding instrument.

## How to read the data

The visualisation shows the level of support publicly expressed by United Nations (UN) Member States for starting the negotiation of a new global agreement to address plastic pollution.

* Blue represents the historic moment when the United Nations Environment Assembly, on 2 March 2022, with its 193 Members States, adopted resolution [UNEP/EA.5/Res.14](https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/39640/K2200733%20-%20UNEP-EA-5-RES-14%20-%20ADVANCE.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) titled 'End Plastic Pollution: Towards an international legally binding instrument', by which it decided to establish an intergovernmental negotiating committee (INC) with a mandate to negotiate an international legally binding instrument to address plastic pollution.
* The darkest green indicates UN Member States that officially co-sponsored the [Draft Resolution by Peru and Rwanda](https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/37395/UNEA5.2%20Global_Agreement_Explanatory%20note%20and%20Resolution%2027%20October.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) to establish an intergovernmental negotiating committee (INC) with a mandate to negotiate a legally binding global agreement to address plastic pollution.
* The less dark green indicates UN Member States that officially called for a new agreement.
* The lightest green shows UN Member States that expressed—including through regional declarations or decisions—a willingness to explore the option of a new global agreement.
* Grey indicates countries for which no public statement or commitment of support (for a new global agreement) has been documented.

### About the data

The estimated level of support by each state is based on WWF’s assessment of publicly available documents, including regional declarations and decisions.
