  The plastic floating in our oceans is a significant threat to our marine ecosystems. Seabirds, fish and marine mammals can become entangled in or ingest plastic debris and, as a result, toxic pollutants can accumulate in the food chain. In addition to its environmental impacts, floating plastic can also adversely affect our economy, specifically the tourism and fisheries sectors.

Once it has entered the oceans, floating plastic and other debris are moved by wind and currents and slowly broken down into smaller and smaller pieces by their exposure to waves and sunlight.

While much of the debris stays in coastal waters and ends up ashore on beaches and coastlines, some of it is transported offshore by winds and currents and commonly ends up in one of the five principal gyres. These are large rotating systems that slowly move the floating debris towards their centres, resulting in large areas of high plastic concentration. In addition, other areas of high concentration can be seen close to river mouths and in marginal seas with low levels of water inflow like the Mediterranean Sea.

### How to read the data

The map layer shows the **estimated concentration of floating plastic** by weight and per km<sup>2</sup>, specifically for plastic items measuring 0.33 mm or more. The darker the colour, the higher the estimated concentration of floating plastic is.

#### Please keep in mind

* This study only looks at **floating plastic** and does not consider the significant portion of plastic items that sinks. Plastic pollution has been documented throughout the water column, including at the bottom of the worldâ€™s deepest trench at 11,000 metres below sea level.
* Due to limitations of the data collection method, this study only included plastic items with a **minimum size of 0.33 mm** and thus does not account for any smaller plastic pieces. Further, subsequent analysis using aerial imagery indicates that the data collected also appears to have underestimated the presence of the larger macroplastics with a size of 200 mm and above.
* The modelled estimates are conservative and are thus best considered to be minimum estimates.
* The accumulating trash does not form solid garbage patches (or even solid islands) as is often portrayed in popular media. Instead, the plastic pollution can be better understood as an omnipresent plastic soup that contains varying concentrations of independently floating plastic items of all types and sizes.
* While the original model estimates were made available for each of the four size classes, this visualisation shows the aggregated values for all classes.

### About the study

The plastic concentration estimates are based on numerical modelling that simulated and tracked virtual particles for multiple input scenarios using historic data representing 30 years of ocean currents.

The model results were calibrated using survey data from 24 expeditions that collected data for four different size classes:
* microplastics between 0.33 and 1 mm in size
* microplastics between 1 and 4.75 mm in size
* mesoplastics between 4.75 and 200 mm in size
* macroplastics larger than 200 mm

**The study estimated a global total of 5.25 trillion floating plastic pieces which together weigh over 268,000 tonnes.**

You can further explore the survey data of the 24 expeditions in the interactive [Sailing Seas of Plastic](http://app.dumpark.com/seas-of-plastic-2/).

*The availability of data on marine plastic pollution is still limited and needs significantly more funding in scientific research to improve the knowledge and therefore the search for solutions.*
