In March 2022, UN Member States made a historic decision, through [UNEA Resolution 5/14 (pdf)](https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/39812/OEWG_PP_1_INF_1_UNEA resolution.pdf), to **develop an international legally binding instrument to end plastic pollution**, with the aim of concluding the negotiation by end of 2024.

This presents a unique opportunity for countries to tackle this global problem together through common global rules: a well-designed, effective treaty can harness the collective power and joint resources of the international community, to deliver systemic change across the full plastic life cycle and reverse the currently worsening plastic pollution trajectory.

Together, governments can deliver impacts at speed and scale to eliminate the threat of plastic pollution with the new treaty. This requires the new treaty to include comprehensive measures across the life cycle of plastic, in the form of specific global rules, targeting priority categories of high-risk plastic pollution. Necessary support must also be provided to countries, for effective implementation of those measures globally.

Control measures—to address the amount of plastic produced, consumed, and disposed of, and the rate at which these plastics are directly and indirectly introduced into the environment—can be clustered into the three main groups "Reduce", "Circulate", "Manage" that you can select above.
