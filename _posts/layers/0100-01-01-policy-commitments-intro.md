title: Tracking the negotiation of the new plastic pollution treaty
---

In March 2022, the United Nations Environment Assembly decided, through adoption of [Resolution 5/14 (pdf)](https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/39812/OEWG_PP_1_INF_1_UNEA%20resolution.pdf), to **develop an international legally binding instrument to end plastic pollution**, with the aim of concluding the negotiation by end of 2024. WWF calls on all states to develop an ambitious treaty that include all of the following specific, binding measures, as they are all indispensable to the global mission of ending plastic pollution.

The negotiation of the new treaty on plastic pollution presents a unique opportunity for countries to tackle this global problem together, through common global rules: a well-designed, effective treaty can harness the collective power and joint resources of the international community, to deliver systemic change across the full plastic life cycle and reverse the currently worsening plastic pollution trajectory.

Together, governments can deliver impacts at speed and scale to eliminate the threat of plastic pollution with the new treaty. This requires the new treaty to include comprehensive measures across the life cycle of plastic, in the form of specific global rules, targeting priority categories of high-risk plastic pollution. Necessary support must also be provided to countries, for effective implementation of those measures globally. WWF’s [submission (pdf)]( https://apps1.unep.org/resolutions/uploads/230106_wwfs_submission_on_potential_options_for_elements_towards_an_international_legally_binding_instrument_0.pdf) to the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee, provides further information on WWF’s key recommendations on the potential options for elements towards an international legally binding instrument.

The Global Plastic Navigator tracks the states’ level of support during negotiation for four groups of provisions as key indicators for the development of an ambitious and effective treaty to end plastic pollution. These include ‘Global Bans & Phase-outs’ of certain plastic categories of concern, ‘Circularity Requirements & Standards’ towards a non-toxic circular economy for remaining plastics, ‘Environmentally Sound Waste Management’ for plastic waste, and ‘Implementation support’ to enable countries’ effective implementation of the treaty.
