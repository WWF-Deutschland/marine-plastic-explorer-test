  Gyres are large rotating current systems formed by predominant winds and forces created by the Earthâ€™s rotation. Featuring lighter winds and currents at their centres, floating plastic is slowed down and accumulates, resulting in large areas of high plastic concentration.

The **five main gyres** shown here are located in the North and South Pacific, the North and South Atlantic as well as the Indian Ocean. While areas of high plastic concentration are present in all five gyres, the most prominent accumulation zone of marine debris, commonly referred to as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, is located in the North Pacific Ocean.

The direction of rotation of these large current systems is determined by the Coriolis effect. Currents are deflected to the right in the Northern Hemisphere, resulting in a clockwise rotation, while currents in the Southern Hemisphere are deflected to the left, resulting in an anticlockwise rotation.

## How to read the data

Icons indicate the approximate centre of the five principal gyres as well as the direction of rotation.
