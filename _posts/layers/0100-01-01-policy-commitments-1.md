Where possible, production and consumption of problematic plastics should be significantly reduced. In line with the risk-based approach, initial emphasis should be on the product categories, additives or materials that generate the largest pressure on the system, most frequently end up in the environment, and obstruct the transition towards a non-toxic circular economy. These include, _inter alia_, packaging, and other single-use plastic items, fishing gear and other maritime equipment, and microplastics. Priority lists of such products, additives or materials should urgently be developed

Example (non-exhaustive) measures:

*	Bans and phase-outs of certain product categories, materials or substances deemed to pose a significant risk, including probability of leakage and potential harm to human health and the environment
*	Market-based instruments such as taxes and fees to reduce production, consumption and trade of certain product categories, materials, or substances


## How to read the data

TODO

The visualisation shows the level of support publicly expressed by United Nations (UN) Member States related to a new global agreement to address marine plastic pollution.

* The darkest green indicates ...
* The less dark green indicates UN Member States that have officially called for a new agreement.
* The lightest green shows UN Member States that have expressed — including through regional declarations or decisions — a willingness to explore the option of a new global agreement.
* Grey indicates countries for which no public statement or commitment of support (for a new global agreement) has been documented.

_Clicking on the States shows a brief overview of the state’s level of support and clicking on “Read more” displays detailed information with source._

### About the data

The estimated level of support by each state is based on WWF’s assessment of publicly available documents, including regional declarations and decisions (e.g. Africa, EU, Caribbean, Nordic countries), regional action plans (e.g. Pacific Islands) as well as the Terms of Reference for the Group of Friends in New York.

_The designation of geographical entities and the presentation of the material do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WWF concerning the legal status of any country, territory, or area, or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. The map of countries is reproduced from Natural Earth, a public domain map dataset that is built through a collaboration of volunteers and supported by NACIS (North American Cartographic Information Society)._
