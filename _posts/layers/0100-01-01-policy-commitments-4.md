title: Implementation support
---

Timely, predictable, accessible, and sufficient support, including both financial and technical resources, technology transfer and capacity strengthening, is particularly important for effective implementation of the treaty’s core obligations and control measures. This is one of the indispensable components of an ambitious treaty to end plastic pollution. To ensure that the Parties start out from a more level playing field, primary implementation assistance (e.g., technical, and financial assistance) should be established right at the beginning.

For example, the treaty may include, _inter alia_, an obligation to provide implementation assistance to developing countries and economies in transition, financial mechanisms to directly support the implementation of control measures, for example through a dedicated multilateral fund (e.g., similar to that of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer), and mechanisms to facilitate transfers of technical know-how and technologies to developing countries and economies in transition.

The Global Plastic Navigator tracks the states’ level of support for the treaty’s inclusion of mechanisms to provide necessary support to countries for the effective implementation of their obligations.

States’ convergence on the need to ensure necessary support to countries for the effective implementation of their obligations is taken as one of the key indicators for the development of an ambitious and effective treaty to end plastic pollution.



## How to read the data


The visualisation shows the level of support, publicly expressed by states participating in the negotiation of a new treaty on plastic pollution, for the inclusion of mechanisms to provide necessary support to countries for the effective implementation of their obligations.

* Dark green indicates states that have publicly called for the treaty’s inclusion of at least one or more mechanisms to provide necessary support to countries for the effective implementation of their obligations.
* Light green indicates states that have publicly expressed support for the treaty’s inclusion of at least one or more mechanisms to provide necessary support to countries for the effective implementation of their obligations.
* Grey indicates states that have not expressed support for the treaty’s inclusion of any mechanism to provide necessary support to countries for the effective implementation of their obligations in their latest verbal or written statement on this topic.

### About the data

The estimated level of support by each state is based on WWF’s assessment of publicly available documents, including national and regional declarations and decisions, interventions during meetings of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC), and written submissions to the INC.

A group statement is understood as representing the level of support of all member states of the group, unless indicated otherwise through an individual member state’s statement recorded at the same time.

_The designation of geographical entities and the presentation of the material do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WWF concerning the legal status of any country, territory, or area, or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. The map of countries is reproduced from Natural Earth, a public domain map dataset that is built through a collaboration of volunteers and supported by NACIS (North American Cartographic Information Society)._
