title: Implementation support
---

Timely, predictable, accessible, and sufficient support, including both financial and technical resources, technology transfer and capacity strengthening, is particularly important for effective implementation. To ensure that the Parties start out from a more level playing field, primary implementation assistance (e.g., technical, and financial assistance) should be established right at the beginning.

Examples:

* An obligation to provide implementation assistance to developing countries and economies in transition
* Financial mechanisms to directly support the implementation of control measures, for example through a dedicated multilateral fund (similar to Montreal Protocol’s)
* Mechanisms to facilitate transfers of technical know-how and technologies to countries




## How to read the data

TODO

The visualisation shows the level of support publicly expressed by United Nations (UN) Member States related to a new global agreement to address marine plastic pollution.

* The darkest green indicates ...
* The less dark green indicates UN Member States that have officially called for a new agreement.
* The lightest green shows UN Member States that have expressed — including through regional declarations or decisions — a willingness to explore the option of a new global agreement.
* Grey indicates countries for which no public statement or commitment of support (for a new global agreement) has been documented.

_Clicking on the States shows a brief overview of the state’s level of support and clicking on “Read more” displays detailed information with source._

### About the data

The estimated level of support by each state is based on WWF’s assessment of publicly available documents, including regional declarations and decisions (e.g. Africa, EU, Caribbean, Nordic countries), regional action plans (e.g. Pacific Islands) as well as the Terms of Reference for the Group of Friends in New York.

_The designation of geographical entities and the presentation of the material do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WWF concerning the legal status of any country, territory, or area, or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. The map of countries is reproduced from Natural Earth, a public domain map dataset that is built through a collaboration of volunteers and supported by NACIS (North American Cartographic Information Society)._
