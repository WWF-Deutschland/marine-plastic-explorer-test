While the treaty should include specific measures to ensure improved waste management standards, it is important to recognize that reactive measures alone will do nothing to address the current plastic production and consumption trajectories.

Example (non-exhaustive) measures:

* Prohibition of open dumping, and mandatory strict global standards for landfill operations
* Specific restrictions on disposal methods for certain high-risk product categories, substances, or materials (e.g., ban on disposal of lightweight materials in open dumpsites, or near aquatic systems; or binding targets for separate collection of certain product categories/materials)
* Mandatory development and implementation of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes, including deposit return schemes for certain product categories (e.g., beverage bottles, or certain types of fishing gear)
* Mandatory marking of fishing gear (e.g., building on FAO guidelines); mandatory reporting of lost fishing gear
* Adoption of technological standards for tires and other high-risk products to prevent microplastic release from the source, and of end-of-pipe capture practices to prevent microplastic leakage, such as filters on washing machine.
* Mechanisms incentivising clean-up, both within and beyond national jurisdiction (e.g., through the establishment of a dedicated financial mechanism for clean-up/recovery beyond national jurisdiction)




## How to read the data

TODO

The visualisation shows the level of support publicly expressed by United Nations (UN) Member States related to a new global agreement to address marine plastic pollution.

* The darkest green indicates ...
* The less dark green indicates UN Member States that have officially called for a new agreement.
* The lightest green shows UN Member States that have expressed — including through regional declarations or decisions — a willingness to explore the option of a new global agreement.
* Grey indicates countries for which no public statement or commitment of support (for a new global agreement) has been documented.

_Clicking on the States shows a brief overview of the state’s level of support and clicking on “Read more” displays detailed information with source._

### About the data

The estimated level of support by each state is based on WWF’s assessment of publicly available documents, including regional declarations and decisions (e.g. Africa, EU, Caribbean, Nordic countries), regional action plans (e.g. Pacific Islands) as well as the Terms of Reference for the Group of Friends in New York.

_The designation of geographical entities and the presentation of the material do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WWF concerning the legal status of any country, territory, or area, or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. The map of countries is reproduced from Natural Earth, a public domain map dataset that is built through a collaboration of volunteers and supported by NACIS (North American Cartographic Information Society)._
