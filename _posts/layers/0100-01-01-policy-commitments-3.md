title: Safely Manage
---

While the treaty should include specific measures to ensure improved waste management, it is important to recognize that reactive measures alone will do nothing to address the current plastic production and consumption trajectories. These measures must be complemented by other indispensable components, such as global bans, phase-outs, and global requirements standards to safely circulate plastics, to end plastic pollution

Some (non-exhaustive) examples of global requirements and standards on environmentally sound waste management are:

* Prohibition of open dumping, and mandatory strict global standards for landfill operations;
* Specific restrictions on disposal methods for certain high-risk product categories, substances, or materials (e.g., ban on disposal of lightweight materials in open dumpsites, or near aquatic systems; or binding targets for separate collection of certain product categories/materials);
* Mandatory development and implementation of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes, including deposit return schemes for certain product categories (e.g., beverage bottles, or certain types of fishing gear);
* Mandatory marking of fishing gear (e.g., building on FAO guidelines) and mandatory reporting of lost fishing gear;
* Technical standards for tires and other high-risk products to prevent microplastic release from the source, and of end-of-pipe capture practices to prevent microplastic leakage, such as filters on washing machine;
* Mechanisms incentivising clean-up, both within and beyond national jurisdiction (e.g., through the establishment of a dedicated financial mechanism for clean-up/recovery beyond national jurisdiction)

The Global Plastic Navigator tracks the states’ level of support for the treaty’s inclusion of global requirements and standards to ensure environmentally sound management of the plastics that becomes waste.

States’ convergence on the need to ensure environmentally sound waste management of plastics is taken as one of the key indicators for the development of an ambitious and effective treaty to end plastic pollution.



## How to read the data

The visualisation shows the level of support, publicly expressed by states participating in the negotiation of a new treaty on plastic pollution, for the inclusion of global requirements and standards to ensure environmentally sound waste management of plastics.

* Dark green indicates states that have publicly called for the treaty’s inclusion of at least one or more global requirements and standards to ensure environmentally sound management of the plastics that becomes waste.
* Light green indicates states that have publicly expressed support for the treaty’s inclusion of at least one or more global requirements and standards to ensure environmentally sound management of the plastics that becomes waste.
* Grey indicates states that have not expressed support for the treaty’s inclusion of any global requirement and standard to ensure environmentally sound management of the plastics that becomes waste in their latest verbal or written public statement.

### About the data

The estimated level of support by each state is based on WWF’s assessment of publicly available documents, including national and regional declarations and decisions, interventions during meetings of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC), and written submissions to the INC.

A group statement is understood as representing the level of support of all member states of the group, unless indicated otherwise through an individual member state’s statement recorded at the same time.
