[CHART]

Marine plastic pollution has reached crisis levels. It is estimated that eleven million tonnes of plastic enter the world’s oceans every year, threatening marine life, coastal livelihoods and potentially even human health. It is a global problem that urgently requires a global response: it is time to begin negotiations on a new legally binding global agreement.

As of today, there is no international treaty dedicated to fully tackling this issue. The existing legal framework covering marine plastic pollution is fragmented and ineffective and does not provide the necessary tools for an effective global response to the problem. This issue cannot be solved on a national or regional level or through non-binding, voluntary measures alone. It requires coordinated international action, shared responsibility and a common approach.

Discussions on how the international community should respond to the problem have already started, including under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Programme. WWF is calling on states to use this opportunity to begin negotiations as soon as possible on a new international legally binding agreement to tackle marine plastic pollution.

## How to read the data

The visualisation shows the level of support publicly expressed by United Nations (UN) Member States for a new global agreement to address marine plastic pollution.

* Blue represents the historic moment when on 2 March 2022, the United Nations Environment Assembly, with its 193 Members States, adopted resolution [UNEP/EA.5/Res.14](https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/39640/K2200733%20-%20UNEP-EA-5-RES-14%20-%20ADVANCE.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) titled 'End Plastic Pollution: Towards an international legally binding instrument', by which it decided to establish an intergovernmental negotiating committee (INC) with a mandate to negotiate an international legally binding instrument to address plastic pollution.
* The darkest green indicates UN Member States that have officially co-sponsored the [Draft Resolution by Peru and Rwanda](https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/37395/UNEA5.2%20Global_Agreement_Explanatory%20note%20and%20Resolution%2027%20October.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) to establish an intergovernmental negotiating committee (INC) with a mandate to negotiate a legally binding global agreement to address plastic pollution.
* The less dark green indicates UN Member States that have officially called for a new agreement.
* The lightest green shows UN Member States that have expressed — including through regional declarations or decisions — a willingness to explore the option of a new global agreement.
* Grey indicates countries for which no public statement or commitment of support (for a new global agreement) has been documented.

### About the data

The estimated level of support by each state is based on WWF’s assessment of publicly available documents, including regional declarations and decisions (e.g. Africa, EU, Caribbean, Nordic countries), regional action plans (e.g. Pacific Islands) as well as the Terms of Reference for the Group of Friends in New York.

_The designation of geographical entities and the presentation of the material do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WWF concerning the legal status of any country, territory, or area, or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.
