The treaty must ensure that remaining plastic products—that are not banned or phased out—are effectively circulated in a non-toxic circular economy, and should be subject to requirements and standards for reuse and effective recycling, starting with immediate measures aimed at plastic categories posing the highest risk. This is one of the indispensable components of an ambitious treaty to end plastic pollution. Both positive (i.e., allowed) lists and negative (i.e., not allowed) lists should be considered to specify these requirements and standards.

Some (non-exhaustive) examples of these global requirements and standards are: design standards for high-risk product categories or applications (e.g., packaging), aimed at incentivizing reuse, collection and/or recycling; standards on materials, colours and additives allowed for use in certain products; elimination of toxic additives that make reuse and recycled materials dangerous for human health and the environment; obligations on product information disclosure to improve global transparency (e.g., polymers and chemical additives of products); etc.

The Global Plastic Navigator tracks the states’ level of support for the treaty’s inclusion of global requirements and standards for products and relevant systems to circulate remaining plastics  (those not eliminated) in a non-toxic circular economy.

States’ convergence on the need to ensure a non-toxic circular economy of plastics is taken as one of the key indicators for the development of an ambitious and effective treaty to end plastic pollution.


## How to read the data

The visualisation shows the level of support, publicly expressed by states participating in the negotiation of a new treaty on plastic pollution, for the inclusion of global requirements and standards towards a non-toxic circular economy for remaining plastics (those not eliminated). 

* Green indicates states that have publicly expressed—in their latest verbal or written statement on this topic—support for the treaty’s inclusion of global requirements and standards for products and relevant systems to circulate remaining plastics in a non-toxic circular economy.
* Grey indicates states that have not expressed support for the treaty’s inclusion of any global requirement and standard towards a non-toxic circular economy in their latest verbal or written public statement on this topic.

### About the data

The estimated level of support by each state is based on WWF’s assessment of publicly available documents, including national and regional declarations and decisions, interventions during meetings of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC), and written submissions to the INC.

A group statement is understood as representing the level of support of all member states of the group, unless indicated otherwise through an individual member state’s statement recorded at the same time.
