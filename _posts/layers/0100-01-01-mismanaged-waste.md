  Mismanaged plastic waste entering our environment is a growing global concern. Wind and rain carry it into our rivers and out to sea where it endangers wildlife and can enter the food chain.

Plastic waste that escapes into the environment can be the result of littering, illegal dumping as well as poorly designed waste management systems and is assumed to be highest in areas of poor waste management and high population densities.

## How to read the data

The visualisation shows the global **estimated annual mismanaged plastic waste generation** per km<sup>2</sup>. The darker the colour the higher the estimated amount of mismanaged waste is. Lighter areas indicate smaller amounts and often correspond to areas of low population density.

#### Please keep in mind

* The underlying data on waste generation comes from a variety of sources using different methods. The study used estimates where country-level data was incomplete or not available (see below).
* Combining the country-level data with population densities, the **estimates** shown here can **vary considerably within each country**. As a result, the apparent lack of estimated mismanaged waste — as can, for example, be seen in vast parts of Australia and the world’s deserts — is not an indication of the absence of data but rather the absence of people.
* The model estimates were provided in kg per cell (30 by 30 arc-second grid) where the size of each cell varies with latitude (cells are largest at the equator (~ 0.85 km<sup>2</sup>) and become smaller towards the poles). To account for these differences and the resulting distortion, the data shown in this visualisation has been converted to kg per km<sup>2</sup>.

## About the study

The estimates shown were produced as part of a recent study that looks at multiple future scenarios of plastic waste generation. The estimates were generated at local level by combining:

* country-level data on **waste management**
* high-resolution distributions of **population**
* high-resolution distributions of **gross domestic product (GDP)**

The country-level data on waste management includes per capita municipal waste generation (available for 160 countries), the estimated percentage of plastic waste (105 countries) and the estimated percentage of mismanaged waste (95 countries), all taken from the “Waste Atlas” ([atlas.d-waste.com](http://www.atlas.d-waste.com/)) that is a collection of publicly available data and data submitted by individual experts. Incomplete data was estimated based on statistically significant correlations with GDP (higher GDP correlates with higher waste generation and with lower percentage of mismanaged waste). Global averages were used for countries where no data was available.

**Globally, the study estimates that about 80 million metric tonnes, or 47% of the global annual municipal waste, were inadequately disposed of.**

*The availability of data on marine plastic pollution is still limited and needs significantly more funding in scientific research to improve the knowledge and therefore the search for solutions.*
