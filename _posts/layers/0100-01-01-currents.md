  Driven mainly by global wind systems, ocean surface currents are an important factor for determining the movements and fate of marine plastic pollution.
---

The continuous movements of the surface water (up to a depth of 400 m) are mainly caused by large-scale winds, but waves and differences in temperature and salinity also play a role. Another factor is the Coriolis effect — a result of the Earth’s rotation — that is responsible for the direction the current systems rotate: while currents in the Northern Hemisphere rotate in a clockwise direction, they rotate anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.

## How to read the data

Arrows indicate the direction and approximate location of the world’ prevailing surface currents.

#### Please beware

* Summer currents are shown for the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. The winter currents flow in the opposite direction.
