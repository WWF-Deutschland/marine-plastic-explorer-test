[CHART]

Marine plastic pollution has reached crisis levels. It is estimated that more than eight million tonnes of plastic waste enters the world’s oceans every year, threatening marine life, coastal livelihoods and potentially even human health. It is a global problem that urgently requires a global response: it is time to begin negotiations on a new global legally binding agreement.

As of today, there is no international treaty in place dedicated to fully tackling this issue. The existing legal framework covering marine plastic pollution is fragmented and ineffective and does not provide the tools necessary for an effective global response to the problem. This issue cannot be solved on a national or regional level or through non-binding, voluntary measures alone. It requires coordinated international action, shared responsibility and a common approach.

Discussions on how the international community should respond to the problem have already started, including under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Programme. WWF is calling on states to use this opportunity to begin negotiations as soon as possible on a new international legally binding agreement to tackle marine plastic pollution.

## How to read the data

The visualisation shows the level of publicly expressed support by United Nations member states for a new global agreement to address marine plastic pollution.

* The darkest green indicates countries that have officially co-sponsored the [Draft Resolution by Peru and Rwanda](https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/37395/UNEA5.2%20Global_Agreement_Explanatory%20note%20and%20Resolution%2027%20October.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) to establish an intergovernmental negotiating committee (INC) with a mandate to negotiate a legally binding global agreement to address plastic pollution.
* The less dark green indicates countries that have officially called for a new agreement.
* The lightest green shows countries that have expressed — including through regional declarations or decisions — a willingness to explore the option of a new global agreement.
* Grey indicates countries for which no public statement or commitment of support (for a new global agreement) has been documented.

### About the data

The estimated level of support by each country is based on WWF’s assessment of publicly available documents, including regional declarations and decisions (Africa, EU, Caribbean, Nordic countries), regional action plans (Pacific Islands) as well as the Terms of Reference for the Group of Friends in New York.
