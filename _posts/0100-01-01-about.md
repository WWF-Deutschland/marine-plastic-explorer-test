# About

The Global Plastic Navigator visualises the most recent and high-resolution data of current scientific publications on marine plastic pollution – from mismanaged waste on land, emission of rivers into the oceans and floating plastic concentration in the oceans.

The Global Plastic Navigator aims to continuously show the most current data on plastic pollution. Scientific publications will be scanned and new data regularly updated.

The visualised data is designed to assist decision-makers in developing the best possible strategies to stop the discharge of plastic into the world’s oceans. WWF believes that this global problem urgently requires a global response. This issue cannot be solved on a national or regional level or through non-binding, voluntary measures alone. It requires coordinated international action, shared responsibility and a common approach. A new legally binding agreement is needed.

In the policy layer, the Global Plastic Navigator shows the level of support for a new treaty by country. WWF is calling on states to use this opportunity to begin negotiations as soon as possible on a new international legally binding agreement to address marine plastic pollution.

The sources of the data used are shown explicitly in the layer descriptions with references and if possible, links to the publications.
